        {" "}
        Jiangnan is a large geographical area of China to the south of the
        Yangtze River with fertile and well-watered, famed for its silk and
        handicrafts, and very densely populated. For the last millennium, this
        region has been at the heart of the most dynamic and sophisticated area
        of the country. The mere mention of Jiangnan evokes lyrical images of a
        Chinese water town, with white houses and willows growing along
        riverbanks, where poets wandered and romantic encounters took place. The
        food from Jiangnan is characterized by the use of very fresh
        ingredients, lots of seafood and the skillful use of soy sauce and sugar
        to make rich, tasty braising sauces.
